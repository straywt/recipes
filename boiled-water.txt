Ingredients:
- 1 quart of clear, cold water from a mountain spring, untainted by 
  human or animal contact, not more than one day old. As a substitute,
  you may use normal tapwater if you don't really care about your family.
- 1 cup sea salt flakes. You may substitute table salt if you don't care
  about the quality of your food.

Directions:
1. Place water in a clean pot. 
2. Spread salt on you countertop.
3. Cup you hands in the air over the salt, and scoop the salt fumes 
   towards the pot so the fumes drop into the pot. Do not touch the salt
   or the water with your hands, they are not clean enough and will ruin
   the end product.
4. Place pot on hot coals from a wood fire. You may substitute an electric
   stove if you have no shame.
5. Wait for water to boil. DO NOT LOOK AT THE POT! A watched pot will
   not boil.
6. Once water is at a full boil, remove from heat. If you still feel the 
   need to touch the water, you may do so immediatly before you take it
   off the heat as the rolling boil will sterilize your filthy hands.
7. Let water rest in a cool, dark area for at least ten minutes so the
   juices will re-distribute evenly throughout the pot. Failure to do so
   could result in a dry, tough meal.
8. Serve in a bowl, with a slice of lemon as a garnish (if desired).
9. Refrigerate leftovers immediatly. Can be kept up to three days before
   discarding.
